# Kraft-Chaitin-codes
Adaptive binary stream prefix-free encoding (also the  Kraft-style code)

Implementation of a coding method from:

Compression of data streams down to their information content.

done by G. Barmpalias and Chen Shichao. Since this has the Kraft-Chaitin 
prefix-free coding as a subroutine, an isolated file with this simpler code is included.
