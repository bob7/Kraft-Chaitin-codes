# Kraft-Chaitin-codes
Adaptive binary stream prefix-free encoding (also the  Kraft-style code)

Implementation, by G. Barmpalias and Chen Shichao, of a coding method from:

| [Compression of data streams down to their information content](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02092) |
| ------------------|
|G. Barmpalias and A. Lewis-Pye. IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory Vol. 65(7) 2019|

Since this has the Kraft-Chaitin 
prefix-free coding as a subroutine, an isolated file with this simpler code is included.

Also see a simpler presentation in a [paper by A. Shen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04852) and a [poster on the method](http://barmpalias.net/news_items/kcode_poster_light.pdf)
