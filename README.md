# Kraft-Chaitin-codes
Adaptive binary stream prefix-free encoding (also the  Kraft-style code)

Implementation of a coding method from:

[Compression of data streams down to their information content](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02092) 

G. Barmpalias and A. Lewis-Pye

IEEE Transactions on Information Theory Volume 65, Issue 7 (2019).

by G. Barmpalias and Chen Shichao. Since this has the Kraft-Chaitin 
prefix-free coding as a subroutine, an isolated file with this simpler code is included.

and a [Poster on the method](http://barmpalias.net/news_items/kcode_poster_light.pdf)
